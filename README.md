# kaggle-Toxic-Comment-Classification
Jigsaw monolingual Toxic Comment Classification Experiments


Data Set used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge 
				
For  individual experiments,i tried:

1. Analyse and visualise a dataset – produce charts and document observations

2. Experimentation with four different experiment setups, where i tryied out different options such as:				
●	Data pre-processing techniques – tokenise (e.g. will you use n-grams?), normalise text, apply stopwords, and so on
 						
●	NLP algorithms and techniques – explain choice
 						
●	Text featurisation/transformation into numerical vectors – justify choices like one hot encoding, and other relevant methods
 						
●	Training/text/validate dataset splitting – explained how did i split and why
 						
●	Choices of loss functions and optimisers (if appropriate/relevant) – explained my choices with facts from the results etc
 						
 						
The implementation, methodology and critical thinking is what matters here.
					
3. Train models (for each variation) – showed details of experimentation for each experiment 

4. Performed testing – show visuals such as confusion matrix or other relevant metrics for each experiment 
5. Discussed best results and mentioned if there was any need to adjust and retrain during the experimentation

6. Evaluated the overall attempt and outcome
					

				
Important:
1.	Used kaggle jupyter notebook with tpu
2.	Code is well commented using markup or hash comment
7.	Used tensorflow
